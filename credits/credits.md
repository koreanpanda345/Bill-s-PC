# Credits

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Dudest" %}
This man is the person that inspired me to make Bill's PC. Dudest is someone that you want to be friends with. I was talking about making a bot, but I didn't know what to make, thats where he suggest to make a bot that can store teams for you. I cannot have done this with out him.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Chaos & Zarel" %}
So for people who do not know who Chaos and Zarel are, They are the OGs of Pokemon Showdown and Smogon. A lot of my data will be from Smogon, and I am pretty happy, that I got to talk to them, and get the chance to explain my bot to them. And its fair in my books to give them credit, and a thank you, as they spent some of their time out to talk to me.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="King Wolf & DragonOfSmite & iG Pokefinium Server" %}
So King Wolf\(Wolf\) and DragonOfSmite\(Dragon\) are the OGs that Founded iG Pokefinium. I wish i could credit everyone in the server individual, but the list would be to long, so I will just talk about them as a whole. First thing, I am grateful that Wolf and Dragon allowed me to bring my bot into their server to Introduce it Comp Players, so I can see it an enviroment that I could never create on my owm. But the server did a lot for me. The server taught me the pokemon game mechanics, and a lot about competivite pokemon. Yea sure that doesn't need to be used to make Bill's PC, but the fact that I have This knowledge, I can make this work for anyone, and make it where it will help newer people have a easier time with competivite pokemon. So I want to thank them, and Leave a link to their server, cause They are one of the nicest people I ever meet.

# Bill's PC

## What is Bill's PC?
I mean that's a question that we all have. what is it, or what is on it? But the answer is simple. it's a discord bot. but not just any discord bot.
A discord bot design to make Competivite pokemon so much easier. You maybe wondering, "How?". And the answer is simple as well, the best feature it has, is the ability to
store your teams into the "PC", that will stay they no matter what. So no more losing your teams, when showdown decides to delete your teams. Sounds cool right?

## Why did you make Bill's PC
This might be a question, and it might not be, but explaining it, might help you see why I decide to make this.
The main reason I made this wasn't cause I wanted to be famous, or use this to make money. That's never the cause for me, I do things different.
The reason is that i noticed how often people have their teams being wiped, or having troubles with moving teams from one device to another, or simply, need tools that will help them get better.
That's why I decide to make this, I made this cause I wanted to make something that will help people, you don't even need to be heavily competitive in pokemon to use, anyone can use it.

## What do I do different than other Developers
This question may sound like I am promoting myself, but the truth is, I am  but in a different way.
I do things my own way, and I like doing them. But the things I do differently:
- I listen to what people have to say. 
    Yes other people do this, but I listen to everyone. If you have a suggestion, I want to hear it. No matter if it is stupid or not, I want to hear it.
- I do not ask for money, nor do I expect donations.
    This is something me personally have a strong feeling about doing. My belif is that you donate cause you like the bot. You are showing you support by allowing it to continue being run.
    100% of the donation The bot gets, will 100% be for the bot, I do not use any of it for my personal gain. It feels wrong for me to do this, so I don't do it.
- Interaction with the community
    This is something that others do, but like this is important to me. I chose to interact with people. I enjoy talking to people, and learning stuff from people. To me, it's why I chose to make this.
- I Give Credit.
    This is something I don't see a lot. I will always give people credit. To me, it's something that just feels right, and makes it seem like I did all this by myself, cause I obivous didn't.

## Special Thanks!!!

### Dudest
This man is the person that inspired me to make Bill's PC. Dudest is someone that you want to be friends with. I was talking about making a bot, but I didn't know what to make, thats where he suggest 
to make a bot that can store teams for you. I cannot have done this with out him.

### Chaos & Zarel
So for people who do not know who Chaos and Zarel are, They are the OGs of Pokemon Showdown and Smogon. A lot of my data will be from Smogon, and I am pretty happy, that I got to talk to them,
and get the chance to explain my bot to them. And its fair in my books to give them credit, and a thank you, as they spent some of their time out to talk to me.

### King Wolf & DragonOfSmite & iG Pokefinium Server
So King Wolf(Wolf) and DragonOfSmite(Dragon) are the OGs that Founded iG Pokefinium. I wish i could credit everyone in the server individual, but the list would be to long, so I will just talk about them 
as a whole. First thing, I am grateful that Wolf and Dragon allowed me to bring my bot into their server to Introduce it Comp Players, so I can see it an enviroment that I could never create on my owm.
But the server did a lot for me. The server taught me the pokemon game mechanics, and a lot about competivite pokemon. Yea sure that doesn't need to be used to make Bill's PC, but the fact that I have
This knowledge, I can make this work for anyone, and make it where it will help newer people have a easier time with competivite pokemon. So I want to thank them, and Leave a link to their server, cause 
They are one of the nices people I ever meet.

__Added Speed Calculator__
Just added a speed calculator command. you do not need to know the set for the pokemon. it will calc the pokemon at max speed. if you want to include Choice scarf into the equation, you can type scarf in front of the pokemon's name, like `scarf gengar`. I will later implement it where you can also include speed boosts to the calc.

__Command Added__
[x] Speed Calcs

__Command Updated__
Implement speed boosts to the speed calcs.

__Added Damage Calculator__
People said it wasn't possible(not really i just want to think that, cause this command was really hard to make.) But I was able to do it. Now Bill's PC can calc damage.  instead of just one move, it calcs all for moves of the first set you pass in.  its great. also i made it where i can take a picture of the new update for the update command, so yee.
